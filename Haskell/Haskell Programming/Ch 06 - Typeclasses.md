# Typeclasses

## What are typeclasses?

* A declaration of a type defines how a type in particular is created.
* A declaration of a typeclass defines how a set of types are consumed or used in computations.

It may help to think of typeclases as being like interfaces to data that can work across multiple datatypes. Simply put, typeclasses allow us to generalize over a set of types in order to define and execute a standard set of features for those types.
