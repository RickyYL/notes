# All You Need is Lambda

## What's a function?

A function is a relation between two sets, a set of inputs and a set of outputs.

Functional programming language is a a computer programming paradigm that relies on definitionsand application of functions as the basis for programs. The essence fo functional programming is that programs are a combination of expressions to be evaluated.

Functional programming languages are all based on the lambda calculus and rely on expressions, but they are not all equally pure. 
* Pure FP is just the lambda calculus.
* Impure FP adds ambient effects, mutation and imperative step-wise encoding of instructions.

Being pure and functional leads to Haskell having a high degree of abstraction and composability. 

Haskell features **minimalist syntax, abstract and pure computations**.

## Lotsa lambdas

The lambda calculus has three basic components:
* **Expressions**, a variable name, an abstration, a function application or some combinations. 
* **Variables**, gives a name to a input.
* **Abstractions**.

Functions consist of two parts:
* **Head**, a lambda followed by a parameters.
* Body.

A example labmda expression: $lambda x . x$.
